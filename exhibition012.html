<p>As part of <a href="https://www.vorspiel.berlin/">transmediale & CTM Vorspiel 2023</a>, the router.gallery is presenting <span style="font-style:italic">
Reconnecting… By All Means</span>, an exhibition and performance by Alice Yuan Zhang.
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Alice Yuan Zhang: Reconnecting… By All Means (2023)</span>
<br>
The contemporary networked world runs on metal, blood, fuel, and water. This material weight is obscured by a constant immaterial flow of zeros and ones, with only the dead device to bear witness. What is a human to do? Can you grieve a circuit board without an afterlife? Can you trace your breath through a web of server nodes? Can you stretch an ethernet cable into an umbilical cord? At Panke Gallery, a local router ponders its position. It quietly hosts a static webpage of hallucinations into communication ports and signals. Visual poetics corrode its usual computational logic into an affective material study of all that 'routes' across the ecosystemic body. Offering no single storyline but a broadcast of seeds, artist Alice Yuan Zhang alludes to other technological imaginaries beneath the geopolitical wastelands of linear progress.  
After the presentation at silent green on the occasion of the Transmediale Vorspiel opening, the router will lead a technological grief procession in the form of a walking audio broadcast from silent green, a former crematorium, to panke.gallery, where it will be installed for the rest of the exhibition period. Curious participants are welcome to join this 10 minute activity to metabolize reflections at the pace of bodies in motion together.
